This is a simple Rust IRC client library. If compiled as an executable, it
functions as a bot that joins the channel of your choice and sits there.

It does not use the Rust garbage collector.

At the time of writing, you will want the *incoming* branch of the Rust
compiler to pick up some bug fixes.
